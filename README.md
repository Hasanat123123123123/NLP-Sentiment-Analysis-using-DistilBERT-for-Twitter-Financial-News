# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-using-DistilBERT-for-Twitter-Financial-News

 Task Description: In this code snippet, you will perform sentiment analysis on financial
news-related tweets using the DistilBERT model. The goal is to classify tweets into one of
three sentiment labels: "Bearish", "Bullish", or "Neutral". The dataset can be downloaded with
code below and consists of annotated finance-related tweets with sentiment labels. The
dataset is divided into training and validation subsets. The code will tokenize the tweet texts,
train a DistilBERT-based sentiment classifier, and evaluate its performance.
 You must use HF Trainer or Lightning Trainer for Training/Inference Loops
